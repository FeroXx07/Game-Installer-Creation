### Installation
Let’s start with the basics, Installation of a computer program is **the act of making the program ready for execution**. Installation refers to the configuration of a software or hardware with a view to making it usable with the computer. A soft or digital copy of the piece of software (program) is needed to install it. 

The **process** and the **management** of these kind of activities take a **big role** in many desktop and laptop **manufacturing companies**, so for these it is important that their hardware products function more efficiently, reduce end-user support costs, and minimize end-user business disruptions. 

One such technique is **application packaging**, which is a critical component of an overall software configuration management strategy.
