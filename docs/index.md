## Game Installer Creation

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/FeroXx07/Game-Installer-Creation/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/FeroXx07/Game-Installer-Creation/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## What is Installation?
Let’s start with the basics, Installation of a computer program is **the act of making the program ready for execution**. Installation refers to the configuration of a software or hardware with a view to making it usable with the computer. A soft or digital copy of the piece of software (program) is needed to install it. 

The **process** and the **management** of these kind of activities take a **big role** in many desktop and laptop **manufacturing companies**, so for these it is important that their hardware products function more efficiently, reduce end-user support costs, and minimize end-user business disruptions. 

One such technique is **application packaging**, which is a critical component of an overall software configuration management strategy.

### TYPES OF INSTALLATIONS
**1. Attended installation**

![Attended installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeroXx07/Game-Installer-Creation/main/docs/gifs/WizardGIF.gif)

  Is the most common form of installation. An installation process usually needs a user who attends it to make choices, such as accepting or declining an end-user license      agreement (EULA), specifying preferences such as the installation location, supplying passwords or assisting in product activation.

**2. Silent installation**

![Silent installation](https://github.com/FeroXx07/Game-Installer-Creation/blob/main/docs/images/SilentInstaller.png)

  Installation that does not display messages or windows during its progress.

**3. Unattended installation**

![Unattended installation](https://github.com/FeroXx07/Game-Installer-Creation/blob/main/docs/images/UnattendedInstallation.png)

  Installation that is performed without user interaction during its progress or with no user present at all.

**4. Network installation**

  Network installation, may be done by installing a minimal system before proceeding to download further packages over the network.

## What is Packaging?
Application packaging is a process of binding the relevant files and components to build a customized application for a customer.
Packaging bundles applications and operating systems into a single file called a distribution unit, which format can vary depending on the installer and the operating system, which makes it easier to deploy and install them on user's computers.

### Some advantages of application packaging

-	Simplify the Installation and Un-installation Procedures.
-	Can be advertised. So that on demos and trials can take place.
-	A solid package and its deployment can prevent piracy.
-	A solid package signed with a digital signature/certificate ensure that the distribution unit cannot be corrupted purposely when on the retail or end-user.
-	Upgrading of the application can be done with ease.
-	Customize Applications to suit the user needs.

### Some Packaging formats:
-	Legacy executables `Setup.exe`
-	Microsoft Windows Installer `Setup.msi`
-	Windows store `.appx`
-	Batch/script files `Install.vbs, Install.ps1, Install.bat`
-	Loose Files / Raw Files
